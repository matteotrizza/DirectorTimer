DirectorTimer is a small tool entirely **developed using Artificial Intelligence** (ChatGPT with gpt4 model), made for **content creators** and **streamers** who don't have a direction helping their content production and want an **automated system** to deal with timings.

We all know a too long or too short video may not get the success it deserves, so why not directly deleting the problem with DirectorTimer? You create a small _.txt_ file containing the sections (or chapters) you want your content to be divided into, and how much time you'd like any section to take, and you'll be helped with a big timer reminding you how much time you still have to cover a specific section of your video. Then, to go to the next section, click the dedicated button in the small and comfortable interface or use an API call via your **StreamDeck**.

# General information
DirectorTimer is entirely based on Python 3, with a series of external libraries to manage files, timers and automations.

You can find the application (_.exe_) and the code (_.py_) in the **RELEASE SECTION**.
